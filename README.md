# Editor

The React Draft Editor is a simple and customizable text editor component built with React. It allows users to input and style text using markdown-like syntax. Users can apply formatting such as bold, underline, different text colors, and header styles by typing specific patterns. The editor also features a "Save" button to store the content in the browser's local storage, enabling users to persist their edits even after refreshing the page. Feel free to explore and integrate this lightweight editor into your React projects.
